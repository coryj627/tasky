## Design Direction

The design should feel clean, modern, and productivity-focused with subtle playful elements that make task completion satisfying - think Apple Reminders meets Todoist with minimal interface that keeps content at the forefront.

## Color Selection

Triadic (three equally spaced colors) - Using a calming blue-green primary with warm orange accents and a supporting purple, creating visual interest while maintaining professionalism for productivity focus.

- **Primary Color**: Calm Teal (oklch(0.65 0.15 180)) - Communicates focus, clarity, and productivity
- **Secondary Colors**: Soft Blue-Gray (oklch(0.75 0.05 220)) for backgrounds and Warm Gray (oklch(0.45 0.02 60)) for secondary text
- **Accent Color**: Energetic Orange (oklch(0.70 0.15 50)) for completion celebrations and important CTAs
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White oklch(0.98 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.25 0.02 60)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray oklch(0.96 0.01 220)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.25 0.02 60)) - Ratio 7.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Teal oklch(0.65 0.15 180)): White text (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
  - Accent (Orange oklch(0.70 0.15 50)): White text (oklch(0.98 0 0)) - Ratio 4.6:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey clarity and efficiency with excellent readability for scanning task lists - Inter provides the perfect balance of friendliness and professionalism for productivity apps.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/24px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Category Headers): Inter Semibold/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Task Text): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Small (Meta Info): Inter Medium/14px/tight spacing
  - Button Text: Inter Medium/14px/uppercase tracking

## Animations

Animations should provide gentle feedback for task interactions and category transitions, with satisfying completion celebrations that motivate continued use without being distracting.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Completion animations provide dopamine reward, category transitions maintain spatial awareness, and micro-interactions communicate system responsiveness
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Task completion gets primary animation focus, followed by add/delete actions, with subtle hover states for all interactive elements
